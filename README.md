## About the project
This python framework is part of a Thesis written by Elias Vaardal at the University of Bergen, in cooperation with the Norwegian Research Center (NORCE). The program is a versatile calculation tool for Hydrogen Refueling Stations (HRS) based on avaliable litterature. The tool, written in Python, allows the operator to directly
configure the program through an Excel template. The project follows the industry standard, and uses the Coriolis Flow Meter (CFM) to measure the mass delivered. According to recent litterature, the three largest causes of billing error at an HRS is the uncertainty associanted with the mass measured by the CFM, subsequently it is the mass error related to vented hydrogen, and finally the mass error related to density changes in dead volume. 

The program calculates the uncertainty for the total mass delivered, currently based on simulation data, in addition to correct for dead volume and depressurization of the vents. Additionaly, the system allows for multiple calibration points over mass flow rates for the meter.
